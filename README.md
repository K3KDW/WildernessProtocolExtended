# Wilderness Protocol Extended
The original Wilderness Protocol from QST Feb 1994 sets a standard for emergency communication when outside repeater range. This extension adds functionality for non-amateur users and includes beyond line of sight options.

##Activity Times are the first 5 minutes of the hour, every 3 hours, starting at 7 AM local.
All times are local. Where applicable, feel free to monitor adjacent time zones.

7:00   -  7:05 AM
10:00  -  10:05 AM
1:00   -  1:05 PM
4:00   -  4:05 PM
7:00   -  7:05 PM
10:00  -  10:05 PM
1:00   -  1:05 AM
4:00   -  4:05 AM

## Frequency/Channel selection. Use the first frequency or channel your radio is capable of beginning at the top of the list.
#1  146.52 MHz    (2 meter amateur radio calling frequency. Analog FM.)
#2  GMRS/FRS 19   (GMRS and FRS radios share frequencies "main" talk channel. 462.65 MHz for those with a VFO. Shout to NotARubicon!)
#3  446.0         (70 cm amateur radio calling frequency. Analog FM.)
#4  28.4 MHz      (10 meter amateur radio calling frequency)
#5  7.030 MHz     (40 meter amateur radio QRP center of activity. See notes below)

Users without battery concerns should monitor as often as possible. At minimum they should monitor for the first 5 minutes of every hour.

The frequencies chosen coincide with calling frequencies and commonly used channels because they are likely to be monitored by a larger user base.
Non emergency/priority communication can move to another frequency or channel.

If nothing is heard for the first 4 or so minutes, it is helpful to announce your presence to help establish the "network".
Users should expect to act as a relay for others. In mountainous or otherwise difficult terrain it may not be possible to communicate directly from deep terrain to outside assistance. It may be necessary for multiple users to relay messages back and forth. This takes additional time and careful coordination so patience and careful coordination are critical. Users may not be able to hear each "link" in the relay chain. A long pause in communication that otherwise appears to be going smoothly may not indicate a problem. If in doubt, reach out! Otherwise keep quiet so the established relays can work effectively.

###If your radio is capable of moitoring two of the above frequencies at once, please monitor the following heirarchy on the second slot. The same applies if you have multiple radios.
#1  GMRS/FRS 19   (GMRS and FRS radios share frequencies "main" talk channel. 462.65 MHz for those with a VFO. Shout to NotARubicon!)
#2  446.0         (70 cm amateur radio calling frequency)
#3  28.4 MHz      (10 meter amateur radio calling frequency)
#4  7.030 MHz     (40 meter amateur radio QRP center of activity. See notes below)

If you are within repeater range: Transmist a Long Tone Zero (LiTZ) by holding the DTMF key "0" on your radio while transmitting. Some repeaters are equipped with LiTZ functionality which triggers additional help for emergency use. The type of help and availability varies so research and program appropriate repeaters ahead of your trip when possible.


##7.030 MHz as a last option
Affordable, low power amateur radio kits are common for 7.030 MHz. It is easy to construct a simple dipole antenna which can be installed about as high as you can reach from the ground and used for NVIS propagation to a relatively local coverage area. Many of these radios can be run from either a common 9v battery or 13.8 VDC found in vehicles. Though these radios are often limited to a single frequency, that's also a good thing!. It is possible to build the radio, cut and test the antenna, and pack it all up in a single day. The downside is that this frequency falls in the CW portion of the 40 meter band which usually requires learning morse code. The solution is to learn LowTap (See the repository in the K3KDW Github) which is a much simpler alternative to morse code. If you need help before you learned morse code there's not much hope. If you have the cheat sheet for LowTap handy and have never used it before you should still be able to communicate effectively. Practice is heavily encouraged of course.

##Additional Information
It is always legal to listen to these radio frequencies. For normal use a license is required to transmit on Amateur Radio and GMRS frequencies but EMERGENCY USE REQUIRES NO LICENSE. It is highly recommended to get the appropriate license for the frequency you plan to use because you will gain important proficiency with your equipment and you can legally use the radio for non emergency use. Emergency use is always legal.

Similarly, though some radios are not normally legal for use on certain frequencies, such as the Baofeng UV-5R on GMRS, emergency use is legal and all means of helping others is encouraged. UV-5R owners should monitor 146.52 and GMRS/FRS 19 and respond to emergencies. Transmitting on GMRS/FRS 19 on an unauthorized radio and without a license is legal for emergency use.

The Wilderness Protocol is not limited to the wilderness only. Use the Wilderness Protocol any time communication is especially important or may be limited for example when cell phones, internet, and other communication paths are reduced or absent.

###Differences from the original Wilderness Protocol
Time slots go around the clock instead of 07:00 - 19:00 local time
Higher frequencies are removed and lower frequencies added
Commonly used non-amateur bands are added

#TO DO
Should CB or other frequencies be included? Should GMRS 16 (used by offroaders/overlanders) be included? Did I remove frequencies that should have stayed? It's important to cover as many users as possible with a few frequencies as possible so they will be more effectively monitored. If 10 meters and/or CB are used should it be SSB, FM, AM? Lots of variables for an already questionable frequency.

Is it reasonable to offer LowTap as a last option?

What to do if you or someone else needs help.
  Look them up on APRS?
  
Include the Wilderness Protocol Extended in your hiking/paddling/boatins/etc. plans as well as a copy in your car. Include a qr to a dedicated responders page.

Is there room for WSPR/carrier-pigeon?

Leave room in a conversation for others to speak. This is critical when emergency/priority communication is trying to break through a casual chat.
